				<h2>Midwifery in Bangladesh: A Brief Introduction</h2>
				<p>Bangladesh has made a commitment to end preventable child and maternal deaths by 2030. For reaching the goal the healthcare planners have prioritized antenatal care (ANC), postnatal care (PNC), normal vaginal delivery (NVD), emergency obstetric care and newborn care which directly links to quality maternal health services. Given the plan and large number of maternity cases in Bangladesh, the country demands a huge supply of midwives to ensure healthy motherhood.  An estimated 22,000 midwives will be required to meet the national need. To address this, the Government introduced midwifery into the health system. Moreover, United Nations; ‘Every Woman Every Child’ plan gives the midwifery program a momentum. To help attain the country target, BRAC University launched the ‘Developing Midwives Project’ (DMP) and introduced the course in 2012 as the first ever midwifery education initiative in Bangladesh’s private sector. Funded by the UK Government, this innovative education initiative develops around 230 midwives every year in partnership with six renowned NGOs of Bangladesh. Dr Selina Amin is the Director of the Developing Midwives Project and the Head of the Midwifery Education Programme.</p>
