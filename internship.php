						<h2>Internship programme at BRAC JPGSPH</h2>
						<p>While interning at BRAC JPGSPH, the students learn about core public health issues in the context of a developing country. They become oriented to field work by visiting various (access to different targeted health interventions and focus on social determinants that impact health) disadvantaged and marginalized communities as well as different field sites. The interns also promote research, education, and capacity-building in the area of health and development; between the host institution and BRAC JPGSPH. The interns a¬ffiliate with both ongoing research activities at the School and with their own research projects; which guides them towards fulfilling the requirements for a graduate degree at their host institution.</p>

We tailor to the need of the intern, the ongoing research and programme. However, BRAC JPGSPH recommends an engagement of minimum of 3 – 4 months to make the experience beneficial for both the intern and the organization.</p>
